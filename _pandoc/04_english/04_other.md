##  【Loyola MBA Application Personal Statement】
 
I obtained my Bachelor's degree from the School of Economics and Management of Tsinghua University in Beijing in 1986. Tsinghua is one of the top-ranked universities in China. The School of Economics and Management is the first business school in mainland China accredited by AACSB and is the only one with both AACSB and EQUIS accreditation. The former Premier Zhu Rongji was the founding dean of the School. I received my Master's degree in Economics and Master's degree in Statistics from the University of Toledo, Ohio in 1993. I was admitted to the Economics Doctoral Program by Cornell University in 1993. Due to my personal financial situation and family responsibilities, I decided to enter the job market and started my career in information technology. During the past 15 years, I have applied my management knowledge into my professional practice and have had increasing responsibilities in various roles and capacities. I worked as an independent IT consultant for several years with my own incorporated company and handled every aspect of the business operations. I was the Vice President of Product Development for a small software product company and led the effort in developing the leading Financial Aid Management System for higher education institutions. With my current employer Lockheed Martin, I also have ascending responsibilities. I was a principal investigator leading a small team on a mission critical R & D project. The team developed a prototype system that was successfully demonstrated to our government customer. The effort received accolades from Lockheed, the customer and our technology partner.  I am currently working as an Integrated Product Team (IPT) lead for United States National Archives Electronic Records Archives program, I am responsible for the full life cycle development of the Search & Access project from customer liaison, systems engineering, software development to testing and deployment. I was able to meet every milestone on time with limited resources within project scope and budget constraints. I have received various awards from Lockheed including the prestigious Honors Recognition award in 2008 for my strong technical leadership and my contribution and commitment to the organization.
 
The theory and practice of management have always been my interest. I enjoy reading books on management, in particular, books by Peter Drucker, the Father of Management Science. I first read his classic "The Effective Executive" when I was in college many years ago and find myself drawn back to it from time to time ever since. I applied his advice and techniques in both my professional practice and my personal life. I am very much influenced by his philosophy of "Efficiency is doing things right, Effectiveness is doing the right things". I always make sure what the right things are first before I even think about doing things the right way. Former GE CEO Jack Welch's books are also my favorites. His second book "Winning" has had a profound impact on my professional work. I apply his "4 E and 1 P" framework in my daily work. I am always positive, energetic. I motivate and energize people, especially during tough times such as schedule crunches and unexpected obstacles. At difficult times, I always help the team analyze the situations with a positive perspective and navigate through the storms with the team together. When it comes to leadership and management, I put more emphasis on people than on processes. People are the center of any human endeavor. As Peter Drucker has it, "Management has mostly to do with people, not techniques and procedures. Their engagement is what matters". I even go further to say that engagement should not only apply to associates and employees. The management and the managers' engagement in the day to day work are equally important, especially in a large corporation with many layers of hierarchies. 
 
I am also interested in and very much intrigued by ancient Chinese philosophy. As I read the ancient stories and texts, I always relate them to management theory and practice today. Even though they were written thousands of years ago, these books contain theories on management and leadership that are very much applicable in modern society. "The Art of War" written during 6th century B.C. by Sun Tzu is one of the oldest books on military strategy in the world. In its opening chapter it talks about five key elements that define the war strategy - The Moral law, Heaven, Earth, the Commander and the Method and Discipline. It says "The Moral Law causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger ". This is what we all know as vision and mission in business management.  It is the number one factor that drives business activities and determines the survival and sustainability of a business. Especially at times of great danger or even chance of defeat, the Moral Law is what binds the soldiers together with the generals and the commander. Heaven and Earth represent the natural, socio-economical environment that businesses have to operate under but have no control over. The commander is the modern CEO who has to effectively communicate the vision and mission to employees and strive to lead the organization into victory and prosperity in a competitive landscape with great uncertainty. To be successful, a business also needs to have the right processes and good discipline. Ancient armies with primitive weapons applied these five fundamental principles to win battles and wars. Modern businesses today, even well equipped with advanced technologies still rely on them as core strategies.
 
In this ever changing and globally complex economy, businesses and executives face increasing competitions and challenges. For example, the ability to understand different cultures and to manage virtually and globally is now a new skill required for a manager. The management discipline also needs to advance its knowledge frontier and to develop new strategies to help businesses effectively cope with globalization. As a practitioner of management and leadership, I realize the imperative to acquire new skills in order to stay ahead of the game. As a lifetime student of management science, I realize that there are emerging territories of knowledge that are still uncharted or are only being explored recently. This leads me to the search for an academic program that is focused on theoretical foundation, management strategies and leadership development in a rapidly changing global environment with the right balance of theory and application. Loyola College in Maryland Evening MBA Program stands out. Its emphasis on leadership and teamwork, social responsibility and ethics, application of information technology and creation of value in the global market will help improve my skills and performance in my current job and also prepare me for future challenging responsibilities. Its flexible schedule can accommodate my demanding work and family needs. In return, my real-world hands-on experiences in both technology and management can contribute to the success of peer students and the program. I will bring back fresh ideas and polished skills from this program to my work place and further contribute to Lockheed's innovative culture and full-spectrum leadership initiative.

## 【Loyola MBA Capstone Personal Reflection】

As I sit down, reflect and write this last paper for my MBA program, 
I feel a sense of relief. The long and arduous journey has finally come to an end. 

I started this part-time MBA program over five years ago in the Fall of 2008. I was a senior software engineer and technical lead at that time and was aiming to grow my career to become a project manager and eventually to move up in the corporate ladder at Lockheed Martin. MBA program was a natural choice especially one from an accredited institution like Loyola. This would provide me with business knowledge, leadership skills， and the credentials necessary to get ahead in a large corporation. 

The first few courses went by rather fast and painlessly thanks to the quantitative nature of the courses and the excitement I had at the very beginning. As time went by, courses were getting more and more complex. Some are both qualitative and quantitative,  some require case studies, projects， and presentations. With the initial excitement subsiding,  it has become more and more challenging to keep up. At the same time, I also came to realize that the corporate ladder is not as straightforward as I thought. I observed cronyism and bureaucracy at my workplace and started having doubts about my original career development plan. It became apparent to me that a MBA degree wouldn’t be of much help. From time to time, I was thinking of giving up my MBA program. 

Thanks to the interesting courses and engaging professors, I was able to keep going despite the setback. Loyola courses offer the right balance of theory and practical application which make them so much approachable to full-time professionals like me. Loyola professors are professionals themselves with years of real-life experiences. They respect and nurture students and encourage class participation which makes the classes lively and fun. I was often able to relate the course materials and discussion topics to my work situations and used what I learned from the classroom to improve my performance at work.

I entered the program with the goal of obtaining a MBA degree and the plan of using it as a shining credential to enhance my career advancement. Over the past five years, I have learned, experienced. and gained so much from this program that my initial goal and plan have become much less relevant.  

Today, I am a better leader and manager because of my Loyola business education. I learned management theory and leadership skills from a management & leadership course a couple of years ago. The knowledge and skills were reinforced in the business ethics course later when we examined the ethical dilemma of businesses and the moral obligations of leaders. Near the end of the business strategy course, professor Everett really hit the homerun when he discussed personal effectiveness and its importance in the successful implementation of business strategies. Professor Everett used materials and ideas from Stephen R. Covey’s best-selling book “Seven Habits of Highly Effective People”. Coincidentally, I bought and read the book over two decades ago when it first came out and the book still sat in my bookshelf with dust since then. Of course, I went home that night after the class and immediately took the book out of the shelf, shook off the dust and started refreshing my memories. 

An effective leader is first an effective person. Personal effectiveness is driven by who you are rather than by what you do or what you say. To be effective, we have to start with building trust with our character ethics and internal strength rather than charisma ethics and external strength. I examined the leaders in my workplace and could hardly find good examples. Some leaders don’t engage themselves in the daily work, show very little concern for the employees. You rarely see them on the floor and interact with employees. The rare time you hear from them is likely from emails which most often than not were written to urge people to work harder, evenings or weekends, in order to hit the deadline. This kind of apathetic top-down bureaucratic management structure and leadership style have plagued everywhere in corporate America.  

Loyola puts the right amount of emphasis on ethics and leadership development throughout the course of its business curriculums. In addition, the professors interject into their courses with ethics and leadership issues.This prepares the students to become better leaders. I was able to apply the principles and techniques I learned from the program to my daily work over the past several years and see myself improve and grow.

As a technical lead and project manager, I led a cross functional team of about a dozen members including business analysts, software developers, and testers. We are very productive and effective as a team. But at the same time, we enjoy strong personal relationships and have fun working together. While corporations, especially larger ones, put process and profit over people, I do exactly the opposite. I am more like a small business owner running a small shop. I take ownership and responsibility. I am on the ground day in and day out with my team members. They are more of my peers than subordinates. I don’t give orders, rather I provide support and directions. I respect everyone and treat them fairly and equally. At the same time, I have high standards and hold everyone accountable. For high performers, I recognize and reward them. But everyone is not performing at the same level in a team. For those lacking behind, I provide timely feedback and constructive criticism so that they realize the problem and make improvements. People are different. They all have different strengths and weaknesses in addition to different interests and dislikes.  I try to downplay their weakness and focus on their strength. I also find out what their interests are and try to align assignments with their interests. When team members compliment and cover for each other, a team becomes most effective and thriving. 

Caring for employees is not just about paying them and providing them with employment benefits. Care has to be given to employees in their daily work. The software lead of my team has a long commute. I provided him with a laptop so that he can work from home once per week. Several occasions, when he was supposed to come on site but the road condition was bad due to inclement weather, I  sent him text messages early in the morning and asked him to stay and work from home. What goes around comes around. Care for and trust in your employees are not just the right things to do, they come back to help the team and the business bottom line. My team members go extra miles without hesitation when we have tight schedules. They also are more proactive in their work and require little supervision. I know of some leaders who micromanage their employees and the team ends up with low morale and low productivity. 

In his famous Gettysburg address in 1863, Lincoln spoke of “Government of the people, for the people, by the people”.  This should apply to business as well. Any business, small or large, profit or not, is human endeavour and should be of the people, for the people and by the people. People are the beginning, the end and the core of any business. Business leaders talk frequently about customers, employees, suppliers,and partners and how important they are. But in fact, they only see them as tools for corporate profits and shareholder returns. Profits and returns always triumph people. This is a very sad reality of corporate America.
Today, as I look forward to entering the finish line of the program, I see beyond the degree certificate and its perceived face value. The past five years have already been transformative for me at both personal and professional level. I am more knowledgeable in the business environment and business operations. I am more skillful in critical analysis and decision making. But most importantly, I am a better person and a better leader coming out of this program. Better yet, Loyola and its dedicated professors and staff have equipped me with tools and skills to continue to grow better and stronger as a future leader with a higher and broader impact on my family, community, workplace and the society as a whole.

Despite the busy work schedule and MBA courses,  I also was able to squeeze in two Marathon races, Baltimore Marathon in 2011 and Marine Corp Marathon in 2012. I consider my Loyola MBA program a Marathon MBA since it takes me more than 5 years to complete and both require dedication, discipline and perseverance. Crossing the Marathon finish line is just the beginning of a healthy lifestyle as I continue to run on a regular basis. By the same token, Completing the Marathon MBA is certainly not the end of the story. It is only the beginning of a new chapter in my life long learning, personal and professional development.

## 【RMU Doctoral Application Personal Statement】

I have been working in the information technology field for over two decades and have held various positions with increasing responsibilities from software engineer, system engineer, and chief engineer to technical lead, project manager, scrum master, and VP of product development. I have worked in both the private sector such as telecommunication, software product development, banking and financial industries and in the public sector supporting federal government agencies including IRS, NARA, SSA, FDA, and FAA. While my work mostly relates to addressing business issues with practical solutions, I am always interested in theoretical inquiries and philosophical thinking. One key aspect of my profession is to apply lessons learned from one domain area to another, one client to another. This requires the skills of generalization and abstract thinking. Some areas of my interests include systems thinking, leadership development and organizational culture. These interests propelled me to pursue a part-time professional MBA degree from Loyola University Maryland in 2008. I finished my MBA program and obtained the degree in 2014.
 
I recently accepted a job offer as a principal systems engineer from MITRE and started my new career on Monday March 21, 2016. Different from my previous employer Lockheed Martin which is a for-profit publicly traded large corporation, MITRE is a not for profit organization and is focused on conducting objective researches on critical national issues ranging from homeland security to cyber security, from defense to healthcare, and providing unbiased advisory to the federal government agencies without conflicts of interests. Instead of implementing solutions and supporting operational systems which have been the major focus of my career with Lockheed Martin in the past ten years, MITRE’s primary mission is to conduct research and development on critical national matters and to advise federal government agencies in defining strategies, selecting vendors and validating solutions. This is a paradigm shift in my career. I will have to deal with more abstract and high level issues and matters. I will have to do more writings, perform more analysis. I will have to do more presentations. I realize that I need to upgrade my research skills in order to excel in my new position and to better serve the government sponsors. Thanks to a former colleague at Lockheed, current colleague at MITRE, current student in the RMU doctoral program, Fred Robinson, I was invited to attend the information session held at Washington Center and also attended the follow-on session at MITRE the following day.  I got to meet Dr. Rota, Dr. Kohun, and Dr. Paulett. I was truly impressed by their enthusiasm about the program and their commitment to the students' success.  A doctoral degree is no longer an abstract goal in my dream. It is attainable and it will be both fun and fulfilling at RMU thanks to the warmth and care they have shown to me and other interested professionals.  
 
I had a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Management Information System from Tsinghua University, a nationally top-rated university in Beijing, China with a strong tradition in science and technology. I also had a Master of Art degree in Economics and a Master of Science degree in Statistics both from the University of Toledo. While these academic studies provide a strong foundation for my pursuit of the doctoral degree, I know that I need to improve the skills of conducting rigorous research both at academic and applied level. I need help from a program that can not only refresh and reinforce what I have already learned but more importantly also teach me research methodology and academic inquiry skills. From my interaction with the three faculty members, I am convinced that they possess the knowledge and techniques and they can guide me through the process. I also take comfort knowing that all faculty members of the program are available all the time, willing and happy to help us. This personal touch is especially valuable for professionals like me who have to balance work and family while pursuing academic degrees. The above national average of the graduation rate of RMU program is a testament of the value of this unique approach.
 
I believe this doctoral program will prepare me for future challenges and opportunities. The cohort, executive style, in-person, on premise program not only accommodates the special needs of working professionals, but also takes advantage of the collective and diversified experiences and wisdom of professionals from all walks of lives. I appreciate the opportunity to be reviewed and considered as a candidate for this great program and am looking forward to the journey at RMU very soon.

## 【Incense as An Economic Barometer】

A specialty gift store owner in New York City reported an interesting observation that "incense sales have always been a great barometer of the economy in my store. As the economy tanks, candle sales drop and incense sales pick up."

Like the stock market, incense can be an economic barometer? incense sales and candle sales go in opposite directions just like interest rate and bond price?

This gets me thinking. Why?

People use candles to decorate their homes and to create a romantic atmosphere. So candles are considered luxury goods. When the economy is bad, demand for the luxury goods goes down, hence candle sales go down.

On the other hand, incense is mostly for religious rituals, meditation, personal reflection, relaxation, and aromatherapy. When the economy is bad, people endure more hardship and more stress. Burning incense can help relax the body,  calm the mind, and soothe the soul. It is also inexpensive. During hard times, people tend to work out more, such as running, practicing yoga. People also tend to be more spiritual and look inward for peace and strength. All these lead to more use of incense.
